Unit testing is like testing a unit of code, function, or
classes.

Rules for unit testing:
    ⓵ Test should be independent.
    ⓶ There should not be any implementation logic in
        unit test.
    ⓷ Test should be simple, fast, clean, & readable.

In Flutter everything is widgets. So, we have to write test cases for widgets as well !!

Rules for unit testing:
    ⓵ Test should be independent.
    ⓶ There should not be creating any new widget.
    ⓷ Test should be simple, fast, clean, & readable.

```
